**API link:** https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline/

Formerly was trying to use https://api.weather.gov/, but I found most of its endpoints are not supported and very frequently fail to deliver data. Therefore, I have switched to the Visual Crossing weather API. I am having to re-design quite a bit, since Visual Crossing doesn't use these office-X-Y grid points like Weather.gov did.

See this Google Doc for more details on the project proposal:
